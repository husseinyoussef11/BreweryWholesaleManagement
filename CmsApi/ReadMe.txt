Hello

In order to use this project please use below:

* in the api properties untick then tick generate xml document to makesure swagger reads the needed xml
* additional apis list brewries and list wholesalers can be used to input parameters of other apis
* if no data in both additional apis , use createmock in brewerycontroller
* in swagger apis are marked by function as document ex : FR1 , FR2 ...


note: there should be a login and usermanagement for wholesalers , breweries and clients then use token from jwt to identify the logged in one and use it in apis,
but sadly i dont have enough time to apply the full senario . 

Thank you in advance
